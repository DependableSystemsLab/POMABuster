The comment on line 54 of FlanBackstop.sol states "the opportunity for price manipulation through flash loans exists", and I agree that this is a serious risk. While the acceptableHighestPrice variable attempts to limit the maximum price change of the flan-stablecoin LP, a flashloan sandwich attack can still occur within this limit and make up for the limitation with larger volumes or multiple flashloan attacks. Flashloan price manipulation is the cause for many major hacks, including bZx, Harvest, and others.

## POMA
Line 83 of FlanBackstop.sol calculates the price of flan to stablecoin in the Uniswap pool based on the balances at a single point in time. Pool balances at a single point in time can be manipulated with flash loans, which can skew the numbers to the extreme. The single data point of LP balances is used to calculate the growth variable in line 103, and the growth variable influences the quantity of pyroflan a user receives in the premium calculation on line 108.

uint256 priceBefore = (balanceOfFlanBefore * getMagnitude(stablecoin)) / balanceOfStableBefore;
uint256 growth = ((priceBefore - tiltedPrice) * 100) / priceBefore;
uint256 premium = (flanToMint * (growth / 2)) / 100;
Problems can occur when the volumes that the purchasePyroFlan() function sends to the Uniswap pool are large compared to the pool's liquidity volume, or if the Uniswap pool price is temporarily tilted with a flashloan (or a whale). Because this function purposefully changes the exchange rate of the LP, by transferring tokens to the LP in a 2-to-1 ratio, a large volume could caught a large price impact in the LP. The code attempts to protect against this manipulation in line 102 with a require statement, but this can be worked around by reducing the volume per flashloan and repeating the attack multiple times. A user can manipulate the LP, especially when the LP is new with low liquidity, in order to achieve large amounts of flan and pyroflan.
