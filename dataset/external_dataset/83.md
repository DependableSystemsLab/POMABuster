NOTE: this is not a POMA. The ICSE'23 paper put it into the wrong hole.
## POMA
In USDMPegRecovery deposit and withdraw allow for direct deposits of a specific token (3crv or usdm).

The balances are directly changed and tracked in storage.

provide seems to be using the real balances (not the ones store) to provide liquidity.
Because of how curve works, you'll be able (first deposit) to provide exactly matching liquidity.
But after (even just 1 or) multiple swaps, the pool will be slightly imbalanced, adding or removing liquidity at that point will drastically change the balances in the contract from the ones tracked in storage.

Eventually users won't be able to withdraw the exact amounts they deposited.

This will culminate with real balances not matching user deposits, sometimes to user advantage and other times to user disadvantage, ultimately to the protocol dismay.

Proof of Concept
Deposit equal usdm and 3crv
LP
Do one trade on CRV
Withdraw the LP

The real balances are not matching the balances in storage.

User tries to withdraw all their balances, inevitable revert.
