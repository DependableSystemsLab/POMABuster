## POMA
In the Pricing contract, an agent can manipulate the trading prices by spamming a high amount of trades.

Indeed an agent can create a high amount of orders at an arbitrary price and with a near-zero amount (so the agent doesn't even need large funds); next he/she pairs the orders with another account and calls Trader.executeTrade; now every order calls a Pricing.recordTrade using the arbitrary price set by the agent.

Since the trades are all made in the same hour, by the way hourlyTracerPrices[currentHour] is calculated, it skews the average price towards the price set by the agent. This arbitrary value is used to calculate the fundingRates and the fairPrice, allowing a malicious agent the ability to manipulate the market.


## Attack Transaction
```
// assign values
operator = 0x85beF3a368849FC1ff6820af7382372e30830986 (msg.sender)
receiver = 0xB4e16d0168e52d35CaCD2c6185b44281Ec28C9Dc (counter party)
token1 = 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48 (USDC)
token2 = 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 (WETH)
amount0Out = amount0In = 10e8
amount1Out = amount1In = 1
make_order = {
    token1, token2, amount0Out, amount1In
}
take_order = {
    token1, token2, amount0In, amount1Out
}
// execution path
(off chain operations) make_orders = [MakeOrder(token1, token2, amount0Out, amount1In)] * 3
(off chain operations) take_orders = [TakeOrder(token1, token2, amount0In, amount1Out)] * 3
Trader.executeTrade(make_orders, taker_orders)
Pricing.recordTrade(tradePrice)
(Insert any any arbitrage transactions that call Pricing.getHourlyAvgOraclePrice()) 
```

## Note
This case does not include any arbitrage - any external operations interact with `Pricing.getHourlyAvgOraclePrice()` results in an arbitrage. Even though the value of `amount0In` and `amount1In` is relatively small, however, if the attack want to take the attack orders, he has to cross all the legit orders, which eventually make the whole trade large in numbers.
